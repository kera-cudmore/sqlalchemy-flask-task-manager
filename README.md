## Design

### Colour Scheme

![Colour scheme for relational task manager](documentation/colour-scheme.png)

I have used `#9575CD` and `#673AB7` as the main colour highlights for the site, used for the headers, footers, titles, task collapsibles and category cards.

`#000000` & `#FFFFFF` have been used for the text on the site and the background of the site and collapsible tasks.

`#F44336` & `#00C853` are used for the edit and delete buttons.

### Typography

Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for use in the site.

### Imagery

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and desktop using ...

### Features

The website is comprised of 6 pages: The home page which displays all tasks, a categories page which displays all categories, an edit categories page which allows the user to edit a category, an edit task page which allows the user to edit a task, an add category page which allows userts to create a new category and an add task page which allows users to create a new task.

All Pages on the website have:

* A favicon. The favicon for the site was created at [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/).
  * Font Title: Leckerli One
  * Font Author: Copyright (c) 2011 [Gesine Todt](www.gesine-todt.de), with Reserved Font Names "Leckerli"
  * [Font Source](http://fonts.gstatic.com/s/leckerlione/v16/V8mCoQH8VCsNttEnxnGQ-1itLZxcBtItFw.ttf)
  * [Font License: SIL Open Font License, 1.1](http://scripts.sil.org/OFL))

* A navbar. The navbar contains links to the home, new tasks and categories pages. The navbar is responsive and on smaller devices uses the hamburger icon. When this is clicked the menu opens to the left of the screen.

* A footer. The footer contains a copyright message and states that the site is for educational purposes. The footer is fully responsive.

Future Implementations.

* Login functionality
* Defensive programming & user authentication

### Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. This has been have achieved by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
* Providing information for screen readers where there are icons used and no text.
* Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
